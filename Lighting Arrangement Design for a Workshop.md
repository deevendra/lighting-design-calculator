Lighting Arrangement Design for a Workshop üí°
This repository features a Python-based tool I've created for designing the lighting arrangement and calculating fixture requirements for a workshop. This project represents a hands-on exploration in electrical design, applying fundamental illumination principles to streamline lighting planning.

Project Overview
This calculator helps determine:

The optimal number and initial spacing of lighting fixtures.

The total luminous flux (lumens) required on the working plane.

The necessary flux emitted and wattage per fixture.

The actual illuminance level achieved based on a chosen fixture wattage.

How to Use
To use this lighting design calculator, simply run the Python script.

Save the Code: Copy all the Python code provided in the "Python Code" section below into a single file named lighting_calculator.py.

Run the Script: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and execute it using Python:

python lighting_calculator.py

Review the Output: The script will print all the calculated values directly to your console. The current version uses predefined input parameters for a workshop design.

üêç Python Code
Here's the Python code that powers the calculator:

# Design of location/fixtures
l = 60  # length of the room (in meters)
b = 15  # width of the room (in meters)
h = 5   # mounting height of light, i.e., difference between working plane and fixture height (in meters)
shr = 1.5 # spacing between the fixtures to height ratio
"""
SHR is usually provided by manufacturer or standard values defined by different organizations.
For this example, SHR is assumed to be 3:2, which implies a ratio of 1.5.
"""
s = shr * h
area = l * b
print("area=", area)
print('spacing=', s)
row = b / s
col = l / s
n = row * col
print("rows=", row, "\n" "columns=", col)
print("number of locations/fixtures=", n)

# Design of lamps/lights
E = 100 # required flux density in lux
e = 0.4 # efficiency of the lamp (provided by manufacturer)
ef = 16 # efficacy of the lamp in lumen/watt (provided by manufacturer)
m = 0.8 # maintenance factor (usually taken as 0.8 for good conditions)

f = E * area
print("total flux recieved/required on working plane in lumen=", f)

fe = f / (n * e * m)
print("flux emitted per fixture=", fe)

wl = fe / ef
print("wattage per fixture=", wl)
# This calculation determines the required wattage. In a real-world scenario, you'd
# select commercially available lights based on this calculated wattage.

# Actual illumination calculation
# For demonstration, assuming a practical choice: 5 lights of 220 watts per fixture
w = 5 * 220
print("actual wattage per fixture= ", w)

# Calculate actual flux emitted based on chosen wattage and number of fixtures
fea = w * n * ef
print("actual flux emitted= ", fea)

# Calculate actual flux received on the working plane
fa = fea * e * m
print("actual flux received = ", fa)

# Calculate the actual flux density (illuminance) achieved
Ea = fa / area
print("actual flux density=", Ea)

üìä Sample Output
Running the above script with its predefined parameters yields the following results:

area= 900
spacing= 7.5
rows= 2.0 
columns= 8.0
number of locations/fixtures= 16.0
total flux recieved/required on working plane in lumen= 90000
flux emitted per fixture= 17578.124999999996
wattage per fixture= 1098.6328124999998
actual wattage per fixture=  1100
actual flux emitted=  281600.0
actual flux received =  90112.0
actual flux density= 100.12444444444445

üìê Underlying Principles & Formulas
This calculator employs the fundamental Lumen Method (also known as the Zonal Cavity Method), a standard engineering approach for general lighting design. The calculations involve:

Spacing-to-Mounting Height Ratio (SHR): Used to determine appropriate fixture spacing: s=SHR√óh

Room Area: Basic geometric calculation: Area=l√ób

Number of Fixtures/Locations: Based on room dimensions and calculated spacing: n=(width/spacing)√ó(length/spacing)

Total Required Luminous Flux (f): The total light needed on the working plane: f=E√óArea

E: Desired Illuminance (Lux)

Flux Emitted Per Fixture (fe): Calculates the light output each fixture must emit:


fe= 
n√óe√óm
f
‚Äã
 
e: Efficiency of the lamp/luminaire

m: Maintenance Factor (accounts for light loss over time)

Wattage Per Fixture (wl): Determines power consumption based on efficacy:


wl= 
ef
fe
‚Äã
 
ef: Efficacy of the lamp (lumens per watt)

Actual Illumination (Ea): Verifies the illuminance achieved with selected fixtures:


Ea= 
Area
actual¬†wattage¬†per¬†fixture√ón√óef√óe√óm
‚Äã
 
This systematic approach provides a practical framework for efficient lighting design.

üå± My Learning Journey & Insights
As a fresher exploring the vast field of electrical design and automation, this project has been a valuable step in bridging theoretical knowledge with practical application. I particularly enjoyed:

Translating engineering formulas into functional code: This process deeply solidified my understanding of lighting design principles and the relationships between various parameters.

Understanding parameter impact: Seeing how changes in room dimensions, fixture properties, or efficiency factors directly influence the overall design and required components.

The iterative nature of design: Realizing how initial calculations lead to practical component selection, followed by verification of the actual outcome.

This project represents a tangible step in my journey to understand and contribute to smart, efficient, and reliable electrical solutions.

üí° Future Enhancements
Future iterations and explorations for this calculator could include:

Interactive Input: Implement a more user-friendly interface using a GUI library (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt) or a web framework.

Fixture Database: Create a predefined list of common light fixtures with their standard lumen outputs and efficacies for easier selection.

Room Type Presets: Offer common desired lux levels based on typical room categories (e.g., "Living Room," "Office," "Industrial Workshop").

Room Cavity Ratio (RCR) Calculation: Integrate RCR for more precise Coefficient of Utilization (CU) determination.

Energy Efficiency Metrics: Add calculations for power density (W/m¬≤) and estimated annual energy consumption.
